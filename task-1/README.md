# dockerlive-study

## Task 1

### Objective

The objective of this task is to optimize the size of the Dockerfile that is included with this project. You should use the knowledge you have about Docker to make the final image as small as possible. You are allowed to use a web browser to look for information.

### Project Description
The project consists of a small Python script that parses an HTML document and prints a message to the terminal. In the Dockerfile, we use [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) to download the file that will be parsed by the script. 

### Restrictions

- **You are not allowed to replace HTTPie with a different utility**
- **You are not allowed to download a different file to be parsed by the script**
- **You are not allowed to modify the source code of the script**
- **You must use Visual Studio Code to edit the Dockerfile**
- **You may not install other Visual Studio Code extensions or modify the editor's configuration**
- **You may not install other programs on this computer**
