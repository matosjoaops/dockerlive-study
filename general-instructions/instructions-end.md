## General Rules

- In each task you will be asked to edit a Dockerfile according to the instructions that are provided.
- Once you think you have accomplished what was requested for that task, notify the observer.
- You should **only edit the Dockerfile**.
- Feel free to consult this document at any time.
- You have a maximum of 20 minutes to complete each task.
- You are allowed to use a web browser to look for information while performing the tasks. However, **you are not allowed to use tools and applications besides those present on the remote machine, do not use tools present on your computer unless explicitly stated, for example, if you need to use a web browser, use the one that is installed on this machine instead of using one that is installed on yours.**
- **You are not allowed to modify the source code of the scripts in each task.**
- **You must use Visual Studio Code to edit the Dockerfile.**
- **You may not install other Visual Studio Code extensions or modify the editor's configuration.**
- **You may not install other programs on this computer.**
- All the information you need to solve the tasks is present in this document.
- If there is something you do not understand while reading this document, notify the observer immediately.

## Instructions

- In the /home/study/Desktop folder, alongside these instructions, you will find three folders: "task-1", "task-2" and "task-3". Each of these directories contains the files that are required for each task.
- Do the tasks in order and notify the observer before starting and after finishing **each** task. After finishing a task and notifying the observer, fill the section of the questionnaire that corresponds to the task you just completed (again, this should be done on **your** machine, anything else should be done using what is installed on the remote machine).
- Instructions for each task are available in the remaining sections of this document. **Please read them carefully. Note that each task may have other restrictions besides those listed previously.**
- Once you are ready, notify the observer and start task 1 (the instructions for this task can be found right after this section).
