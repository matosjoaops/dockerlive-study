# Improving the Developer Experience of Dockerfiles - Study

## General Instructions

Before proceeding, please fill the first two sections of the form linked below. Please open this link on **your** machine i.e. do not use the remote machine's web browser to fill the questionnaire. Beyond this point, everything else should be done using the applications installed on the remote machine. Once you reach the "Task 1 Experience" section, minimize the questionnaire (**do not close it or try to submit it**) and continue to read this document.

In this experiment you will perform 3 tasks. In each task you must edit a Dockerfile using Visual Studio Code. Since you will be interacting with Docker through a terminal while performing these tasks, we included a cheat sheet that provides some basic information about the most common Docker commands. If you already have experience with Docker's command-line interface, feel free to ignore the cheat sheet. Otherwise, you have 5 minutes to look at it and familiarize yourself with the different commands (although you can look at it again while performing the tasks if you feel the need to do so). Notify the observer if there is something you do not understand.
